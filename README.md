The BG770A CAN Bus module library provides your Arduino with CAN Bus capabilities through the Quectel BG770A cellular module. This library allows you to read and write messages to the CAN Bus while maintaining cellular connectivity. The BG770A is a powerful LTE Cat-M1/NB-IoT/EGPRS module that also includes integrated CAN Bus functionality.

CAN Bus is a messaging protocol system that lets various microcontrollers and sensors within a vehicle communicate with each other. CAN provides long distance, medium communication speed, and high reliability.

The BG770A module combines cellular connectivity with CAN Bus functionality, making it ideal for automotive IoT applications, fleet management, and remote vehicle monitoring.

With this library, you can:

1. Send CAN2.0 frames through BG770A
2. Receive CAN2.0 frames through BG770A
3. Get data from OBD-II ports
4. Set CAN filters and masks
5. Configure CAN Bus parameters
6. Use both cellular and CAN functionality simultaneously

## Hardware Setup

Connect the BG770A module to your Arduino:

- **VCC** to 3.3V (BG770A operates at 3.3V)
- **GND** to Ground
- **TX** to Arduino RX pin (e.g., Serial1 RX)
- **RX** to Arduino TX pin (e.g., Serial1 TX)
- **CAN_H** to CAN Bus High
- **CAN_L** to CAN Bus Low

## Examples

Here are examples implemented in this library. You can find more examples [here](./examples)

### Basic CAN Send Example

```cpp
// BG770A CAN SEND EXAMPLE
#include <BG770A_CAN.h>

BG770A_CAN can;

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
    can.begin();  // Initialize BG770A on Serial1
    
    // Enable CAN functionality
    if(can.enableCAN()) {
        Serial.println("CAN enabled successfully");
    }
    
    // Set CAN baudrate to 500kbps
    can.setCanRate(CAN_RATE_500);
}

void loop() {
    unsigned char data[8] = {0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x07, 0x08};
    
    // Send CAN frame: ID=0x123, Standard frame, Data frame, 8 bytes
    if(can.send(0x123, 0, 0, 8, data)) {
        Serial.println("CAN message sent successfully");
    }
    
    delay(1000);
}
```

### CAN Receive Example

```cpp
// BG770A CAN RECEIVE EXAMPLE
#include <BG770A_CAN.h>

BG770A_CAN can;

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
    can.begin();
    
    can.enableCAN();
    can.setCanRate(CAN_RATE_500);
    
    Serial.println("Waiting for CAN messages...");
}

void loop() {
    unsigned long id;
    unsigned char buf[8];
    
    if(can.receive(&id, buf)) {
        Serial.print("Received CAN ID: 0x");
        Serial.print(id, HEX);
        Serial.print(" Data: ");
        
        for(int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
            Serial.print("0x");
            if(buf[i] < 0x10) Serial.print("0");
            Serial.print(buf[i], HEX);
            Serial.print(" ");
        }
        Serial.println();
    }
    
    delay(10);
}
```

## BG770A Module Information

The BG770A is a series of LTE Cat-M1/NB-IoT/EGPRS modules with integrated CAN Bus functionality:

- **LTE Cat-M1/NB-IoT/EGPRS** connectivity
- **Integrated CAN Bus** controller
- **Low power consumption**
- **Wide temperature range** (-40°C to +85°C)
- **Compact size** suitable for automotive applications

## Compatible Boards

This library works with any Arduino-compatible board that has hardware serial ports, including:

- Arduino Uno (with SoftwareSerial)
- Arduino Mega
- Arduino Leonardo
- ESP32
- ESP8266
- Seeeduino XIAO
- And many others

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Module not responding**: Check power supply (3.3V), connections, and ensure proper grounding
2. **CAN messages not sending**: Verify CAN bus termination and that CAN is enabled
3. **No CAN messages received**: Check CAN bus connections and baudrate settings

### Debug Mode

Use the debug mode to send AT commands directly to the BG770A:

```cpp
void loop() {
    can.debugMode();  // Forward serial communication for debugging
}
```
